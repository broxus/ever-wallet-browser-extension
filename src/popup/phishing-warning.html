            There are many reasons sites can appear on our warning list, and our
            warning list compiles from other widely used industry lists. Such
            reasons can include known fraud or security risks, such as domains
            that test positive on the EVER Wallet Phishing Detection.
            Domains on these warning lists may include outright malicious
            websites and legitimate websites that have been compromised by a
            malicious actor.
